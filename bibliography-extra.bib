	abstract = {We define a general class of network formation models, Statistical Exponential Random Graph Models (SERGMs), that nest standard exponential random graph models (ERGMs) as a special case. We provide the first general results on when these models' (including ERGMs) parameters estimated from the observation of a single network are consistent (i.e., become accurate as the number of nodes grows). Next, addressing the problem that standard techniques of estimating ERGMs have been shown to have exponentially slow mixing times for many specifications, we show that by reformulating network formation as a distribution over the space of sufficient statistics instead of the space of networks, the size of the space of estimation can be greatly reduced, making estimation practical and easy. We also develop a related, but distinct, class of models that we call subgraph generation models (SUGMs) that are useful for modeling sparse networks and whose parameter estimates are also directly and easily estimable, consistent, and asymptotically normally distributed. Finally, we show how choice-based (strategic) network formation models can be written as SERGMs and SUGMs, and apply our models and techniques to network data from rural Indian villages.},

@inproceedings{Schmid2017,
	abstract = {With the growth of interest in network data across fields, the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) has emerged as the leading approach to the statistical analysis of network data. ERGM parameter estimation requires the approximation of an intractable normalizing constant. Simulation methods represent the state-of-the-art approach to approximating the normalizing constant, leading to estimation by Monte Carlo maximum likelihood (MCMLE). MCMLE is accurate when a large sample of networks is used to approximate the normalizing constant. However, MCMLE is computationally expensive, and may be prohibitively so if the size of the network is on the order of 1,000 nodes (i.e., one million potential ties) or greater. When the network is large, one option is maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE). The standard MPLE is simple and fast, but generally underestimates standard errors. We show that a resampling method---the parametric bootstrap---results in accurate coverage probabilities for confidence intervals. We find that bootstrapped MPLE can be run in 1/5th the time of MCMLE. We study the relative performance of MCMLE and MPLE with simulation studies, and illustrate the two different approaches by applying them to a network of bills introduced in the United State Senate.},

abstractNote = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can also be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},
